In the absence of an official h11>=0.16.0 release on PyPI, we replaced the dependency with a Git-based patched version:

h11 @ git+https://github.com/python-hyper/h11.git@master


This version includes the security fix for CVE-2025-43859

We verified the patch exists in the GitHub repo and matches the security advisory

This ensures compliance with Veracode policy, even though no secure version exists on PyPI

Once h11==0.16.0 is officially published, we will revert to using the versioned PyPI release
